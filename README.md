## Notes

- I faced the challenger when I made the Setting View Controller. I took a lot of hours to learn how to use the
  keys. I realize that it is similar with the dictionary in python.
- I changed the code many times to make sure that my apps is convinient for the users.
- I take a lot of hours to find a pretty icon and beautiful background for MyTip. I want the users like MyTip
  because it is not only an application but it also a wondeful work of art.
