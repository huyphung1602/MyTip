## Notes

- I face the challenger when I made the Setting View Controller. I need to think about how to apply the code right
  as the tutorial on the web explain. I take about 5 hours to understand how to use the NSUserDefaults effectively.
- I change the code many time to make sure that my apps is convinient for the users.
- I take a lot of time to file a pretty icon and beautiful back ground for my apps. I want the user like the apps
  because it is not only an apps but it also a wondeful work of art.
